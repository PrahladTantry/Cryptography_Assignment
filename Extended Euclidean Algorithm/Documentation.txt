Line 1: Defines a public class named ExtendedEuclidean.
Line 2: Defines a static method extendedGCD that takes two integers a and b as input and returns an array of integers.
Line 3: Checks if a is 0. If true, returns an array containing b (GCD), 0, and 1 (Bézout coefficients).
Line 4: If a is not 0, recursively calls extendedGCD with b % a and a.
Line 5: Stores the result of the recursive call in an array named result.
Line 6: Extracts the GCD from the result array.
Line 7: Calculates the Bézout coefficient x using the formula y1 - (b / a) * x1.
Line 8: Sets y to x1 from the recursive result.
Line 9: Returns an array containing the GCD and the Bézout coefficients x and y.
Line 12: Defines the main method to test the extendedGCD function.
Line 13: Initializes two integers a and b with values 56 and 15.
Line 14: Calls the extendedGCD method and stores the result in an array.
Line 15: Prints the GCD.
Line 16: Prints the Bézout coefficient x.
Line 17: Prints the Bézout coefficient y.
