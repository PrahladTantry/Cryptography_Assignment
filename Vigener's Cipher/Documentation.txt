Vigenère Cipher Implementation Explanation

1. Line 1: Defines the `VigenereCipher` class.
2. Line 2: Declares a constant `ALPHABET_SIZE` with a value of 26, representing the English alphabet size.
3. Line 4: The `encrypt` method takes plaintext and a key as input.
4. Line 5: Initializes a `StringBuilder` to store the ciphertext.
5. Line 6: Converts the plaintext to uppercase.
6. Line 7: Converts the key to uppercase.
7. Line 8: Stores the length of the key.
8. Line 10: Iterates over each character in the plaintext using a loop.
9. Line 11: Gets the current character from the plaintext.
10. Line 12: Checks if the character is a letter.
11. Line 13: Converts the character to a 0-25 range (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).
12. Line 14: Gets the corresponding key character and converts it to a 0-25 range.
13. Line 15: Applies the encryption formula: (x + k) % 26.
14. Line 16: Converts the result back to a character and appends it to the ciphertext.
15. Line 17: Increments the key index `j`.
16. Line 19: Appends non-alphabetic characters as is.
17. Line 22: Returns the encrypted ciphertext.

18. Line 24: The `decrypt` method takes ciphertext and a key as input.
19. Line 25: Initializes a `StringBuilder` to store the plaintext.
20. Line 26: Converts the ciphertext to uppercase.
21. Line 27: Converts the key to uppercase.
22. Line 28: Stores the length of the key.
23. Line 30: Iterates over each character in the ciphertext using a loop.
24. Line 31: Gets the current character from the ciphertext.
25. Line 32: Checks if the character is a letter.
26. Line 33: Converts the character to a 0-25 range.
27. Line 34: Gets the corresponding key character and converts it to a 0-25 range.
28. Line 35: Applies the decryption formula: (y - k + 26) % 26.
29. Line 36: Converts the result back to a character and appends it to the plaintext.
30. Line 37: Increments the key index `j`.
31. Line 39: Appends non-alphabetic characters as is.
32. Line 42: Returns the decrypted plaintext.

33. Line 44: The `main` method demonstrates the usage of the Vigenère Cipher.
34. Line 45: Defines the plaintext as "HELLO".
35. Line 46: Defines the key as "KEY".
36. Line 48: Encrypts the plaintext using the `encrypt` method.
37. Line 49: Prints the encrypted ciphertext.
38. Line 51: Decrypts the ciphertext using the `decrypt` method.
39. Line 52: Prints the decrypted plaintext.
